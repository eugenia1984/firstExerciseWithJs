# first Exercise With JS

## What I did 🚀

This is my first exercise learning JavaScript. <br/>
1.   I linked and external JS file (javascript.js) with the HTML file (index.html) with a <script> tag in my <head>. <br/>
2.  In my .js file I ask the user to type three ingredients for a recepie with a prompt and créate one variable for each engredient. <br/>
3. In my .html file I used document.type to show the ingredientes.
